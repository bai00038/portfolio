What challenges I faced during development and how I overcame those changes?
1. **Unfamiliarity with Bootstrap Components**
   At first, I wasn't familiar with how to effectively use Bootstrap's built-in components.
   **Solution**: I explored the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com) and made it a habit to search for relevant components before writing HTML. This helped me apply Bootstrap's utilities more efficiently.
2. **Responsive Layout Across Different Screen Sizes**
   It was challenging to ensure the layout looked good on all screen sizes, especially when dealing with flexible grids and elements.
   **Solution**: Before coding, I reviewed how the design should adapt on different devices and planned my media queries and layout strategy accordingly.
3. **Forgetting CSS Transitions and Animations**
   I struggled to recall how to use transition effects smoothly.
   **Solution**: I reviewed course materials and researched on [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to refresh my knowledge and apply CSS animations correctly.
4. **Mobile Menu Implementation**
   Implementing the menu for smaller screens was difficult because it required JavaScript, which I was new to.
   **Solution**: I learned basic JavaScript to handle toggling the mobile menu and made it functional by integrating it with CSS transitions.

## What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?
* **Improved Understanding of HTML and CSS**
  Building the portfolio helped me strengthen my foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS, especially in structuring content and applying styles consistently.
* **Importance of Reusable Code and Structure**
  I realized the importance of organizing common parts, like headers and footers, into reusable components. Initially, I had to manually update each page when making changes. Moving forward, I plan to learn how to use templating techniques or tools to avoid repetitive code.
* **Using External Libraries Effectively**
  I learned how to integrate and utilize libraries such as Bootstrap and Animate.css. These tools helped speed up the development process and allowed me to create more responsive and interactive designs efficiently.
